10. What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
In SQL, a trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events on a particular table or view in a database. These events can include insertions, updates, or deletions of data, depending on how the trigger is defined. Triggers are used to enforce business rules, maintain referential integrity, and automate complex database operations.

Types of Triggers:
Before Triggers (BEFORE INSERT, BEFORE UPDATE, BEFORE DELETE): These triggers execute before the triggering event (insert, update, delete) occurs. They are typically used to validate or modify data before it is changed in the table.

After Triggers (AFTER INSERT, AFTER UPDATE, AFTER DELETE): These triggers execute after the triggering event has occurred. They are often used for auditing, logging changes, or updating related tables after a change.
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]  -- This clause indicates that the trigger should fire once for each row affected by the triggering event
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements to execute when the trigger fires
    -- You can refer to the old and new values using :OLD.column_name and :NEW.column_name respectively
    -- :OLD is available in DELETE and UPDATE triggers, :NEW is available in INSERT and UPDATE triggers
END;
