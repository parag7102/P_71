4. What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?
It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in your question regarding "MF Cod Rule" in the context of RDBMS systems. Typically, when discussing RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems), we refer to principles and rules that govern their design and operation. These principles are often encapsulated in terms like ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which are fundamental to transaction processing in relational databases.

Here's a brief explanation of the ACID principles:

Atomicity: Ensures that each transaction is treated as a single unit of work, which either completes fully or not at all. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database remains unchanged.

Consistency: Guarantees that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. This means all data constraints, rules, and relationships are maintained during the transaction.

Isolation: Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from each other, even if they operate on the same data concurrently. This principle prevents interference between concurrent transactions and maintains data integrity.

Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed
