5. What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
Data redundancy refers to the duplication of data within a database or between different systems. It occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places unnecessarily. This redundancy can lead to several issues:

1. **Increased Storage Requirements:** Storing the same data multiple times consumes more storage space than necessary.

2. **Data Inconsistency:** If redundant data is not properly synchronized or updated, inconsistencies can arise. For example, if a piece of data is updated in one place but not in another, the different versions can lead to confusion and errors.

3. **Update Anomalies:** Updating redundant data requires making changes in multiple places, which increases the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies.

4. **Complexity:** Managing redundant data increases the complexity of database systems and applications.

To minimize data redundancy, databases are designed with normalization techniques, where data is organized in such a way that redundant information is reduced or eliminated. This helps in maintaining data integrity, improving efficiency, and reducing storage requirements.
