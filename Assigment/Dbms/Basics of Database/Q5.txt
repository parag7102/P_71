5. What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
Data redundancy refers to the practice of storing the same data in multiple places within a database or across different databases. While some level of redundancy can be useful for data recovery and fault tolerance, excessive redundancy can lead to inefficiencies and increased storage requirements.

Here are some key points about data redundancy:

Types of Data Redundancy:
Horizontal Redundancy: In this type, identical data is stored in different rows of the same table. For example, if you have a table of customer records, and the same customer information (such as name, address, and phone number) appears in multiple rows, it is considered horizontal redundancy.
Vertical Redundancy: In vertical redundancy, the same data is stored in different columns of the same table. For instance, if you have a table with columns for “first name” and “last name,” and both columns contain the same information, it is vertical redundancy.
Cross-Redundancy: This occurs when the same data is stored in different tables across the database. For example, if you have a “products” table and a separate “inventory” table, and both tables store the same product information, it is cross-redundancy.
Advantages of Data Redundancy:
Improved Fault Tolerance: Redundancy allows data to be retrieved even if one copy is lost or corrupted. This is crucial for maintaining system availability.
Faster Retrieval: Having redundant copies of data can speed up query performance, especially in distributed systems.
Disadvantages of Data Redundancy:
Increased Storage Costs: Storing redundant data requires additional storage space, which can be expensive.
Data Inconsistency: If redundant copies of data are not synchronized properly, inconsistencies can arise. For example, if a customer changes their address in one place but not in another, it leads to data inconsistency.
Complex Maintenance: Managing redundant data can be challenging. Updates, deletions, and inserts must be carefully coordinated to avoid inconsistencies.
Normalization and Reducing Redundancy:
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables and establishing relationships between them.
By applying normalization rules (such as First Normal Form, Second Normal Form, etc.), you can reduce redundancy and improve data consistency.
