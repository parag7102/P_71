1. What do you understand By Database
A database is a structured collection of data organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It typically consists of one or more tables (or relations), where each table contains rows (or tuples) of data organized into columns (or attributes). Databases are used to store and retrieve large amounts of information efficiently, allowing users or applications to query and manipulate data as needed.

Key characteristics of databases include:

1. **Structure**: Data is organized into tables with predefined schema (structure).
2. **Querying**: Users can perform queries to retrieve specific data using languages like SQL (Structured Query Language).
3. **Management**: Databases provide mechanisms for managing and maintaining data integrity, security, and concurrency.
4. **Scalability**: They can handle large volumes of data and support concurrent access by multiple users or applications.
5. **Reliability**: Systems are designed to ensure data consistency and durability, often through techniques like transactions and backups.

Databases are fundamental to modern applications and are used in various domains such as business, science, government, and more, to store and manage structured data efficiently.
Data Volume: Databases can store massive amounts of data, while spreadsheets have limitations.
