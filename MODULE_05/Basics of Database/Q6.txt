6. What is DDL Interpreter?
The DDL Interpreter is an essential component in database management systems (DBMS). Let me break it down for you:

DDL (Data Definition Language):
DDL deals with defining and modifying the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
It operates at the schema level, focusing on how data should reside in the database.
Common DDL commands include:
CREATE: Used to create databases and their objects (e.g., tables).
ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects.
DROP: Deletes objects from the database.
TRUNCATE: Removes all records from a table and deallocates space.
COMMENT: Adds comments to the data dictionary.
RENAME: Renames an object.
DDL Interpreter:
The DDL Interpreter processes DDL statements, interpreting them into actions that affect the database schema.
It generates a set of tables containing metadata (data about data) stored in the data dictionary.
Essentially, the DDL Interpreter ensures that the database structure aligns with the specified schema definitions.
