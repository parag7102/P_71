1. What do you understand By Database
A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. It serves as a crucial tool used by organizations to store, retrieve, and manage information efficiently1. Here are some key points about databases:

Definition: 
A database is a structured repository for data that allows for rapid search, retrieval, modification, and deletion of information using a computer system2. It typically consists of tables, rows, and columns where data is organized in a way that facilitates efficient processing and querying.
Components:
Data: The actual information stored in the database, which can be anything from customer records to product inventory.
Database Management System (DBMS): Software that manages the database, including tasks like data storage, retrieval, security, and optimization.
Applications: 
Software programs that interact with the database, such as web applications, mobile apps, or reporting tools.
Types of Databases:
Relational Databases: 
These use a structured format with tables, rows, and columns. They rely on a query language called Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and retrieval.
Object-Oriented Databases:
 These store data in objects and support complex relationships between them.
NoSQL Databases:
 Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data, they offer flexibility and scalability for applications like social media and big data analytics.
Cloud Databases:
 Hosted on cloud platforms, these provide scalability, reliability, and accessibility from anywhere.
Databases vs. Spreadsheets:
Data Storage and Manipulation:
 Databases are designed to handle large amounts of organized information, while spreadsheets are more suitable for individual users or small-scale data manipulation.
Access Control:
 Databases allow multiple users to securely access and query data, whereas spreadsheets were originally designed for single users.
Data Volume: Databases can store massive amounts of data, while spreadsheets have limitations.
