3. What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
Certainly! Letâ€™s explore the key differences between Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):

Data Storage:
DBMS: Stores data as files.
RDBMS: Stores data in tabular form (tables).
Data Access:
DBMS: Requires accessing data elements individually.
RDBMS: Allows accessing multiple data elements simultaneously.
Data Relationships:
DBMS: No inherent relationship between data.
RDBMS: Data is stored in related tables.
Normalization:
DBMS: Does not support normalization.
RDBMS: Supports normalization to reduce redundancy and maintain database integrity.
Distributed Database:
DBMS: Does not support distributed databases.
RDBMS: Supports distributed databases.
Data Structure:
DBMS: Uses navigational or hierarchical structures.
RDBMS: Utilizes a tabular structure with column headers and corresponding values.
Data Handling:
DBMS: Deals with small quantities of data.
RDBMS: Handles large amounts of data.
Data Redundancy:
DBMS: Common due to lack of keys and indexes.
RDBMS: Keys and indexes prevent data redundancy.
Codd Rules:
DBMS: Does not satisfy all Codd rules.
RDBMS: Satisfies all 12 Codd rules.
Security:
DBMS: Provides less security.
RDBMS: Offers multiple levels of data security.
User Support:
DBMS: Supports a single user.
RDBMS: Supports multiple users.
Data Retrieval Speed:
DBMS: Slower for large data.
RDBMS: Faster due to the relational approach.
Software and Hardware Requirements:
DBMS: Requires lower software and hardware resources.
RDBMS: Demands higher software and hardware resources.
Examples:
DBMS: XML, Windows Registry, FoxPro, dBASE III Plus, etc.
RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access, etc.
