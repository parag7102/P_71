7. What is DML Compiler in SQL?
Certainly! Let’s delve into the concept of DML (Data Manipulation Language) and explore its significance in SQL.

1.DML Overview:
DML deals with data manipulation within a database. It encompasses the most common SQL statements used to interact with data.
These statements allow you to store, modify, retrieve, delete, and update data in the database.
2.Common DML Commands:
Here are the essential DML commands:
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified conditions.
INSERT: Adds new data into a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data within a table.
DELETE: Removes records from a table.
MERGE: Performs an UPSERT operation (i.e., insert or update) based on certain conditions.
CALL: Invokes a PL/SQL or Java subprogram.
EXPLAIN PLAN: Provides an interpretation of the data access path for query optimization.
LOCK TABLE: Used for concurrency control.
3.Key Points about DML:
DML statements are not auto-committed, meaning changes can be rolled back if necessary.
They directly impact the data stored in the database.
4.Example Usage:
Suppose you want to add a new employee record to an “Employees” table:
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)
VALUES (101, 'Parag', 'Makwana', 'BCA');
5.Why DML Matters:
DML is fundamental for applications that interact with databases. It allows developers to manipulate data dynamically.
Whether you’re building a web application, managing inventory, or analyzing customer data, DML plays a crucial role.
